'''
Write a function named number_grid that accepts two positive integers mm and nn as arguments. Within the function, create a file named numgrid.csv. Write the first mn positive integers to the file in the following way:
•	Each line should be a sequence of nn comma-separated integers.
•	There should be a total of m lines in the file.
For example, for the case of m=5,n=3, the file should be:
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
10,11,12
13,14,15

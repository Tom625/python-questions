'''
Write a function named read_line that accepts a text file named filename and a positive integer n as arguments. Within the function, read the file and return the nth line of the file. If the file has fewer than n lines, return the string 'None'.
________________________________________
(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.txt'.
(2) You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output. You have to write the function definition.

'''
filename points to the name of some text file. Each line in this file is missing a period at the end of the line. Write a function named add_period that accepts filename as argument and creates a new file named out.txt. The function should copy the contents of filename into out.txt and add a period at the end of each line.

(1) filename is a string variable that holds the filename. For example, in the first test case, it is public_1.txt.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the console. You have to write the function definition and within the function, create a file named out.txt according to the required specification.

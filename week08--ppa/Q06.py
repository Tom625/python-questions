A sequence of n terms (a1,a2,…,an) is called an Arithmetic progression (AP) if the difference between any two consecutive terms stays constant. That is:
a2−a1=a3−a2=⋯=an−an−1=d

Some useful terms:
•	a1 is the first term of the AP.
•	d is called the common difference of the AP.
•	n is the total number of terms in the AP.
________________________________________
Write a function named write_AP that accepts the following arguments:
•	a_1: first term of the AP, integer.
•	d: common difference of the AP, integer.
•	n: number of terms in the AP, positive integer.
Within the function, create a file named out.txt and write the first nn terms of the AP to it, one term on each line, starting from the first term.
________________________________________
You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output. You have to write the function definition. Within the function, create the file named out.txt.

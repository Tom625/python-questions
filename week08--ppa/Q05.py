'''
filename points to a file that contains a n×n matrix. The ithith line of the file represents the (i−1)th row of the matrix as a sequence of comma separated integers, where 1≤i≤n. We have used zero-based indexing here. This file doesn't have a header and has exactly nn lines. A sample file is given for your reference:
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
Your task is to return the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].
________________________________________
Write a function named get_matrix that accepts the filename as argument. It should return the matrix as a list of lists. Each cell of the matrix should be an integer and not a string.
________________________________________
(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.txt'.
(2) You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output. You have to write the function definition.

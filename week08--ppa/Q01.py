'''
Write a function named read_file that accepts a text file named filename as argument. Within the function, read the file and print each line of the file on a separate line in the console. You shouldn't print any extra characters at the end of a line. There shouldn't be an empty line between any two consecutive lines.

(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.txt'.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the console. You have to write the function definition and print the contents of the file within the function.

'''
filename points to a CSV file that has two columns. The first column is the name of a student, the second column is this student's age. The first line of the file will always be the header. A sample file is given below for your reference:

Name,Age
Arti,20
Kalam,60
Atul,25
Krishnan,24
Sahana,20
Write a function named get_dict that accepts the filename as argument and returns a dictionary where the keys are the student names and the values are the corresponding ages of the students.

(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.txt'.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output. You have to write the function definition.

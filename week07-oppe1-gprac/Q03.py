'''
Given a square matrix M and two indices (i,j), Mij is the matrix obtained by removing the ith row and the jth column of M.
________________________________________
Write a function named minor_matrix that accepts three arguments:
•	M: a square matrix
•	i: a non-negative integer
•	j: a non-negative integer
The function should return the matrix Mij after removing the ith row and the jth column of M. Note that we use zero-based indexing throughout. That is, if the matrix M is of dimensions n×n, then we have 0≤i,j≤n−1.
________________________________________
(1) You can assume that the number of rows in MM will be at least 33 in each test case.
(2) You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console.

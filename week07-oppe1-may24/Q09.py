def square_and_clip(x: int, threshold:int) -> int:
    '''
    Square the given integer and clip the result to threshold
    (clipping means if the value x goes greater than the threshold, keep it at threshold).

    Arguments:
    x: int - the input number
    threshold: int - the threshold value

    Return:
    int - squared and clipped result

def lowercase_first_half_and_uppercase_second_half(s: str) -> str:
    '''
    Given an even-length string of any case, create a string with the first half 
    in lowercase and the second half in uppercase.

    Arguments:
    s: str - the input string

    Return:
    str - the modified string

def add_the_middle_element_to_both_ends(l: list) -> None:
    '''
    Given an odd-length list, insert the middle element to both ends of the list.
    Modify the input list and do not return a new list.

    Arguments:
    l: list - the input list

    Return:
    None - the input list is modified inside the function.

def number_of_unique_common_digits(n1: int, n2: int) -> int:
    '''
    Given two integers, return the number of unique digits that are common in both numbers.
    Eg, 287498,295424 - 2, 4 and 9 are common to both nums so answer is 3
    Arguments:
    n1: int - the first number
    n2: int - the second number

    Return:
    int - the number of unique common digits.

def manhattan_distance_via_b(a: tuple, b: tuple, c: tuple) -> int:
    '''
    Given three points a, b, and c on the Cartesian plane, 
    calculate the Manhattan distance to go from point a to point c via point b.

    Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.

    Args:
        a (tuple): Coordinates of point a as (x1, y1).
        b (tuple): Coordinates of point b as (x2, y2).
        c (tuple): Coordinates of point c as (x3, y3).

    Returns:
        int: The Manhattan distance from point a to point c via point b.

Sum of Squares of Even Numbers
Write a function sum_of_squares_of_even that takes a list of integers nums and returns the sum of squares of all even numbers in the list.

>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> sum_of_squares_of_even(nums)
56
NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Explanation
In the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The sum of their squares is 4 + 16 + 36 = 56.

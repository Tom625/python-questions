Sum of squares and absolute difference of squares
Write a function sum_squares_abs_diff_squares that takes two integer inputs, a and b, and returns a tuple with:

The sum of the squares of a and b.
The absolute difference of the squares of a and b.
NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example
Given the inputs a = 3 and b = 4:

Explanation

The sum of squares would be 9 + 16 = 25.
The absolute difference of squares would be |9 - 16| = 7.
So, sum_squares_abs_diff_squares(3, 4) should return (25, 7).
